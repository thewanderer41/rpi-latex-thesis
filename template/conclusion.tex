\chapter{CONCLUSION}

Formalizing versioning into a linked data model with a state-based approach and relating version change with changes in their attributes will improve the ability to standardly communicate version information.
The proposed model does not possess the same brevity found in most popular provenance models, but it captures versioning as groups of relationships rather than sets of activities.
This reveals a relationship between versions and their attributes in informing version changes.
The approach led to difficulties encoding versioning information into change logs due to excessive file sizes, but analysis suggests that there may be methods to merge multiple entries.
