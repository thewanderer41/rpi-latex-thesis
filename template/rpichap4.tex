\chapter{VERSIONING TABULAR DATA}\label{ch:spreadsheet}

This chapter uses the Copper and Noble Gas databases to demonstrate the implementation of the model presented in the previous chapter.

\section{VALIDATE COMPARISONS}

The first step in any versioning endeavor is to first establish that the two objects being compared meet the requirements of being each other's versions.
For the copper dataset, the objects result from a compilation effort from the same sources of data.
An entry recording the source material for each row in the table accompanies each reading.
As a result, these entries were used to determine that they share similar provenance.
They will also both be used as data inputs at the same step to generate data visualizations.
The datasets become interchangeable within the context of executing the workflow.
Determining whether the noble gas files are versions is a more challenging activity.
From provenance graphs like the one constructed for the entry CAM001 in Figure \ref{CAM001ProvGraph}, the entries share a common source document.
Likewise, a significant portion of the other entries also share sources from the same body of work.
The ones that do not are new or removed entries.
As there was no personal involvement in the use of this data set, determining whether they can occupy the same workflow step requires actually looking into the files.
Investigating column headers and the accompanying documentation reveals that they report many of the same measurements.
Some amount of leeway is given in this assessment as having every quantity match would mean that the two files aren't versions, but the same object.
This process helps to determine the confidence that using the model to encode the discovered changes will result in a meaningful versioning graph.

\section{FORM A MAPPING}

The next step involves formulating a method to determine whether a relationship constitutes an add, invalidate, or modify mapping.
As discussed in the previous chapter, this relies on determining whether an attribute exists in one version, the other, or both.
However, with tabular data, a row and column attribute is required to match together specific cells.
For the Noble Gas dataset, this is conveniently the entry identifier and the column headers.
Row and column numbers are avoided because edits can result in the same entry associated with different indices.
In addition, the first version of the Noble Gas dataset was organized into multiple files so the same row index would appear more than once, and therefore, could not be used to match together related entries.
An observation that also simplifies identifying edits is that cells are rarely added or removed individually.
When one row gains a cell all other rows gain one as well, perhaps with null values, forming a new column.
As a result, data additions and invalidations only use one identifier.
A basic method to determine the identifiers involved in an addition is straight forward.
A set of identifiers \(\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{R}_{r} - \mathcal{R}_{l}\) where \(\mathcal{R}_{l}\) and \(\mathcal{R}_{r}\) correspond to the row identifiers of the left-hand and right-hand versions, respectively.
A converse procedure reveals the set of invalidated attributes \(\mathcal{I} = \mathcal{R}_{l} - \mathcal{R}_{r}\).
All the remaining identifiers exist in both versions and form a set of possible modification attributes.
These are only possibilities because the mapping procedure does not check for differences, and as a result, rows that have not undergone a change are also included.
The same is done with columns.
This only performs a very basic version mapping, but data producers can significantly improve this with their more intimate understanding of the versions.
For example, the base method would not understand that a Location column has been divided into two columns Latitude and Longitude.
A data producer could manually link the Location attribute to the Latitude and Longitude attributes, forming a single modification instead of an invalidate and two additions.

The copper minerals dataset starts each row with a unique mineral name, and these can be matched across datasets to determine if an entry has undergone a modification.
The column headers have different formats because the initial file is an Excel file and the other was a comma separated file.
As a result, the column headers were manually matched together with the remaining headers in each file mapped into the added and invalidated sets.
The noble gas database also uses unique identifiers to mark each of its entries, but the first version of the database divides data among multiple files.
For this reason, the identifiers must first be collected into a single dictionary data structure mapping identifiers to their files.
The version map is then computed from this data structure.
The database also uses multi-line headers which makes a basic automated approach difficult since the cells are not well aligned.
This means that the columns for this database also had to be mapped manually to find the matching columns.


\section{GENERATE VERSIONING GRAPH}

An encoding can now be generated after a method of mapping has been determined.
In current practice, the method of publishing version information comes in the form of a change log.
In this application, the data is published as a versioning graph, leveraging the structure of the concept model.
This allows the data to be stored into a triple store and then retrieved through queries.
In addition, change log and linked data technologies can be combined together into a hybrid artifact using different encoding schemes that embed linked data graphs into documents.
Execution of these hybrid logs had mixed results as very large graphs with many changes became very difficult to load.
As optimization methods are outside the scope of this application, efficiently merging versioning graphs into change logs is not pursued further.
However, in change logs, changes are presented in sections by type.
As a result, when generating the triples, the changes are collected and organized first, then output.

A selection of triples have been extracted from the larger Noble Gas versioning graph in Figure \ref{NobleGraph1}, demonstrating how entries appear.
The graph reads, EGY001 was added, ANC001 no longer appears, and column 11 of CAM001 underwent a modification.
In the case of Figure \ref{NobleGraph1} and \ref{CopperGraphVerGraph}, the graph was extracted from linked data embedded into a change log.
As a result of limitations in the encoding, a unique attribute combining the column number and the row identifier was used to identify the column attribute.
The decision to combine them was to produce an easier graph to run a flow computation on.
An alternative construction would be to use just the column identifier and share it with other entries.
This results in the graph more similar to Figure \ref{NobleGraph2} where column 11 links to multiple changes.

\section{MULTIPLE LINKED VERSIONS}

Versions do not always appear in pairs.
While the figures in this document so far have depicted a comparison between only two versions, versioning often involves more than two objects, either in sequence or parallel.
Figure \ref{NobleGraph2} shows a graph that follows change as it moves through three versions of the Noble Gas data set.
From the first to second version of the data, EGY001 becomes introduced as an attribute into the dataset.
This entry then undergoes a modification change in columns 29, 31, and 43 when comparing versions two and three.
The construction results in a format naturally oriented to show the flow of change from version one to three.
The advantage of this formation is that now many versions can be related together using a unified set of semantics that cannot be achieved through combining the other concepts and properties in the previous chapter.
This is important since many versioning linked data alternatives view version change as a single contained activity.

Using the construction outlined in the previous three sections, many changes can be compiled together into a graph in a changelog.
After all additions, invalidations, and modifications have been compiled into a single graph, a complete mapping from version one to version two may be developed.
The orientation of the relationships in the graph allows a flow to be created from attributes in version one to corresponding attributes in version two.
Taking version two and performing the same graph construction to a version three results in not only a flow from version two to version three, but also from version one to version three.
As a result, the flow can be used to construct a mapping from version one to version three or any future version.
