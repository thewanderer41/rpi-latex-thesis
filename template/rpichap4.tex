\chapter{VERSIONING SPREADSHEETS}

Two datasets were initially studied.  The "Noble gas isotopes in hydrocarbon gases, oils and related ground waters" database, initially published on June 11, 2013 and then republished a second version on March 8, 2015.  The physical structure of the database changed from eight separate Excel spreadsheets to a single sheet.  The model does not explicitly account for a change like this except that the identifiers used to refer to the versions or attributes involved may show that the items from version one originate from different files.  The original dataset also had 195 columns.  However, these were reduced to 54 columns in the second release.  In addition, many new locations were surveyed and added to the second release.  These are the most challenging 

The Paragenetic Mode for Copper Minerals database produced two versions, one at a workshop on June 8, 2016, and another at a following workshop on August 21, 2016.  These both take the form of Excel spreadsheets, which has the benefit of having strict row and column numbering.
