\chapter{DATABASE VERSIONING}

Databases already maintain a part of versioning history with a transactional log.
However, they pose an interesting change in context compared to spreadsheets.
Often version comparisons occur between instances of spreadsheet files, but with databases, modifying transactions do not generate a new instance of the database.
Identifying a version would then need to adapt and link transactions to versions.
This can be done through query based citations as described by Proll and Rauber \cite{Proell2013}.
The transaction log also more specifically states the attribute involved, making detection of new attributes into the database more straightforward.
This addresses a particular concern in spreadsheet rows since their attributes have a tendency to be less consistent.
Since RRUFF already possesses an automatically, web accessible change log, the work in this area focuses primarily on deconstructing their code to hook in the concept model with RDFa.
