\specialhead{ABSTRACT}

Information systems rely heavily on the quality of data which passes through the components of that system.
Changes to that data can propagate significant influence down the 

Science is constantly changing and the data that drives it changes along with it.
Understanding the behavior of data as it changes to correct errors and to add value, improves data quality and eases data integration.
Current methods to track the evolution of data primarily focus on the collection of data provenance, but lacks the fidelity to evaluate the extent of a change.
The conceptual model proposed in this document addresses this challenge by leveraging semantic technologies to automatically embed versioning information into changelog artifacts generated when changes are made to a dataset.
A method to calculate change distance then follows using the resulting semantic graph by attaching weights to different change types.
Initial applications begin with spreadsheets then databases with the ultimate goal in applying the model to online ontologies.
