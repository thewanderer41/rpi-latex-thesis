  abstract = {The ATLAS detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider presents data handling requirements on an unprecedented scale. From 2008 on the ATLAS distributed data management system, Don Quijote2 (DQ2), must manage tens of petabytes of experiment data per year, distributed globally via the LCG, OSG and NDGF computing grids, now commonly known as the WLCG. Since its inception in 2005 DQ2 has continuously managed all experiment data for the ATLAS collaboration, which now comprises over 3000 scientists participating from more than 150 universities and laboratories in 34 countries. Fulfilling its primary requirement of providing a highly distributed, fault-tolerant and scalable architecture DQ2 was successfully upgraded from managing data on a terabyte-scale to managing data on a petabyte-scale. We present improvements and enhancements to DQ2 based on the increasing demands for ATLAS data management. We describe performance issues, architectural changes and implementation decisions, the current state of deployment in test and production as well as anticipated future improvements. Test results presented here show that DQ2 is capable of handling data up to and beyond the requirements of full-scale data-taking.},

or products are vertical and usually deal with the flagship,
successful projects. There is a substantial lack of
horizontal studies to shed light on the whole population of
projects, including failures. This paper presents a horizontal
study aimed at characterizing OS projects.
We analyze a sample of around 400 projects from a popular
OS project repository. Each project is characterized
by a number of attributes. We analyze these attributes
statically and over time.
The main results show that few projects are capable of
attracting a meaningful community of developers. The
majority of projects is made by few (in many cases one)
person with a very slow pace of evolution.
We then try to observe how many projects count on a substantial
number of developers, and analyze those projects
more deeply. The goal is to achieve a better insight in the
dynamics of open source development.
The initial results of this analysis, especially growth in
code size and tendency to stability in modularity, seem to
be in line with traditional close source development.},

The paper presents a case study, documenting the pattern of acquisition, management, and usage at the Louis Calder Memorial Library of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Health sciences journals were early to offer electronic alternatives to print. As a result, health sciences libraries, their patrons, and the public at large were early to embrace the new versions and continue to embrace the significant changes in scholarly communication they enable. Although the patterns of electronic journals among health sciences libraries and other special and academic libraries have similarities, they also have differences. Broad studies of electronic journals in non-health sciences libraries have been published, but a retrospective review of electronic journals in health sciences libraries has not.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility of scientific research relies on accurate and precise citation of data and the provenance of that data. Earth science data are often the result of applying complex data transformation and analysis workflows to vast quantities of data. Provenance information of data processing is used for a variety of purposes, including understanding the process and auditing as well as reproducibility. Certain provenance information is essential for producing scientifically equivalent data. Capturing and representing that provenance information and assigning identifiers suitable for precisely distinguishing data granules and datasets is needed for accurate comparisons. This paper discusses scientific equivalence and essential provenance for scientific reproducibility. We use the example of an operational earth science data processing system to illustrate the application of the technique of cascading digital signatures or “hash chains” to precisely identify sets of granules and as provenance equivalence identifiers to distinguish data made in an an equivalent manner.},

As an important way to measure the similarity between pairwise graphs error-tolerantly, graph edit distance (GED) is the base of inexact graph matching. The research advance of GED is surveyed in order to provide a review of the existing literatures and offer some insights into the studies of GED. Since graphs may be attributed or non-attributed and the definition of costs for edit operations is various, the existing GED algorithms are categorized according to these two factors and described in detail. After these algorithms are analyzed and their limitations are identified, several promising directions for further research are proposed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The National Climate Assessment of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) analyzes and presents the impacts of climate change on the United States. The provenance information in the assessment is important because the assessment findings are of great public and academic concern and are used in policy and decision-making. By applying a use case-driven iterative methodology, we developed information models and ontology to represent the content structure of the recent National Climate Assessment draft report and its associated provenance information. We tested the ontology by using it in pilot systems serving information about instances of chapters, scientific findings, figures, tables, images, datasets, references, people, and organizations, etc. in the draft report, as well as interrelationships among those instances. The results successfully help users trace provenance in the draft report, such as finding all the journal articles from which a figure in the report was derived. The provenance information in our work was maintained in the context of the “Web of Data”. In addition to the pilot systems we developed, other tools and services are also able to retrieve and utilize the provenance information. Our work is part of a Global Change Information System coordinated by the \{USGCRP\} that will eventually cover provenance information for the entire scope of global change research. Such a system will greatly increase understanding, credibility and trust in the global change research and foster reproducibility of scientific results and conclusions. },

  abstract = {In recent years, a number of data identification technologies have been developed which purport to permanently identify digital objects. In this paper, nine technologies and systems for assigning persistent identifiers are assessed for their applicability to Earth science data (ARKs, DOIs, XRIs, Handles, LSIDs, OIDs, PURLs, URIs/URNs/URLs, and UUIDs). The evaluation used four use cases that focused on the suitability of each scheme to provide Unique Identifiers for Earth science data objects, to provide Unique Locators for the objects, to serve as Citable Locators, and to uniquely identify the scientific contents of data objects if the data were reformatted. Of all the identifier schemes assessed, the one that most closely meets all of the requirements for an Unique Identifier is the UUID scheme. Any of the URL/URI/IRI-based identifier schemes assessed could be used for Unique Locators. Since there are currently no strong market leaders to help make the choice among them, the decision must be based on secondary criteria. While most publications now allow the use of URLs in citations, so that all of the URL/URI/IRI based identification schemes discussed in this paper could potentially be used as a Citable Locator, DOIs are the identification scheme currently adopted by most commercial publishers. None of the identifier schemes assessed here even minimally address identification of scientifically identical numerical data sets under reformatting.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work is the development of Grid-based approaches through which NASA data centers can become active participants in serving data users by transforming archived data into the specific form needed by the user. This approach involves generating custom data products from data stored in multiple NASA data centers. We describe a prototype developed to explore how Grid technology can facilitate this multi-center product generation. Our initial example of a custom data product is phenomena-based subsetting. This example involves production of a subset of a large collection of data based on the subset's association with some phenomena, such as a mesoscale convective system (severe storm) or a hurricane. We demonstrate that this subsetting can be performed on data located at a single data center or at multiple data centers. We also describe a system that performed customized data product generation using a combination of commodity processors deployed at a NASA data center, Grid technology to access these processors, and data mining software that intelligently selects where to perform processing based on data location and availability of compute resources. This demonstration also suggests that we could create a catalog of phenomena related data at multiple data centers, in which the catalog can contain references to the original data in different locations. The catalog is important to providing other users with efficient access to the data belonging to the identified phenomenon.},
