  abstract = {The ATLAS detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider presents data handling requirements on an unprecedented scale. From 2008 on the ATLAS distributed data management system, Don Quijote2 (DQ2), must manage tens of petabytes of experiment data per year, distributed globally via the LCG, OSG and NDGF computing grids, now commonly known as the WLCG. Since its inception in 2005 DQ2 has continuously managed all experiment data for the ATLAS collaboration, which now comprises over 3000 scientists participating from more than 150 universities and laboratories in 34 countries. Fulfilling its primary requirement of providing a highly distributed, fault-tolerant and scalable architecture DQ2 was successfully upgraded from managing data on a terabyte-scale to managing data on a petabyte-scale. We present improvements and enhancements to DQ2 based on the increasing demands for ATLAS data management. We describe performance issues, architectural changes and implementation decisions, the current state of deployment in test and production as well as anticipated future improvements. Test results presented here show that DQ2 is capable of handling data up to and beyond the requirements of full-scale data-taking.},

  abstract      = {Most empirical studies about Open Source (OS) projects
or products are vertical and usually deal with the flagship,
successful projects. There is a substantial lack of
horizontal studies to shed light on the whole population of
projects, including failures. This paper presents a horizontal
study aimed at characterizing OS projects.
We analyze a sample of around 400 projects from a popular
OS project repository. Each project is characterized
by a number of attributes. We analyze these attributes
statically and over time.
The main results show that few projects are capable of
attracting a meaningful community of developers. The
majority of projects is made by few (in many cases one)
person with a very slow pace of evolution.
We then try to observe how many projects count on a substantial
number of developers, and analyze those projects
more deeply. The goal is to achieve a better insight in the
dynamics of open source development.
The initial results of this analysis, especially growth in
code size and tendency to stability in modularity, seem to
be in line with traditional close source development.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility of scientific research relies on accurate and precise citation of data and the provenance of that data. Earth science data are often the result of applying complex data transformation and analysis workflows to vast quantities of data. Provenance information of data processing is used for a variety of purposes, including understanding the process and auditing as well as reproducibility. Certain provenance information is essential for producing scientifically equivalent data. Capturing and representing that provenance information and assigning identifiers suitable for precisely distinguishing data granules and datasets is needed for accurate comparisons. This paper discusses scientific equivalence and essential provenance for scientific reproducibility. We use the example of an operational earth science data processing system to illustrate the application of the technique of cascading digital signatures or “hash chains” to precisely identify sets of granules and as provenance equivalence identifiers to distinguish data made in an an equivalent manner.},

  abstract      = {Inexact graph matching has been one of the significant research foci in the area of pattern analysis. As an important way to measure the similarity between pairwise graphs error-tolerantly, graph edit distance (GED) is the base of inexact graph matching. The research advance of GED is surveyed in order to provide a review of the existing literatures and offer some insights into the studies of GED. Since graphs may be attributed or non-attributed and the definition of costs for edit operations is various, the existing GED algorithms are categorized according to these two factors and described in detail. After these algorithms are analyzed and their limitations are identified, several promising directions for further research are proposed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The National Climate Assessment of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) analyzes and presents the impacts of climate change on the United States. The provenance information in the assessment is important because the assessment findings are of great public and academic concern and are used in policy and decision-making. By applying a use case-driven iterative methodology, we developed information models and ontology to represent the content structure of the recent National Climate Assessment draft report and its associated provenance information. We tested the ontology by using it in pilot systems serving information about instances of chapters, scientific findings, figures, tables, images, datasets, references, people, and organizations, etc. in the draft report, as well as interrelationships among those instances. The results successfully help users trace provenance in the draft report, such as finding all the journal articles from which a figure in the report was derived. The provenance information in our work was maintained in the context of the “Web of Data”. In addition to the pilot systems we developed, other tools and services are also able to retrieve and utilize the provenance information. Our work is part of a Global Change Information System coordinated by the \{USGCRP\} that will eventually cover provenance information for the entire scope of global change research. Such a system will greatly increase understanding, credibility and trust in the global change research and foster reproducibility of scientific results and conclusions. },
