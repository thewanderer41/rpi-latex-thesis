\chapter{ONTOLOGY VERSIONING}


Since there exists an implementation of the GCMD Keywords in RDF, the URIs can be used as references for the Attributes in the concept model.  As mentioned in Reference 8, in order for a data consumer to understand how to use a new version of an ontology, they need not only understand what concepts are new and what concepts are old, but also how to map the old ontology onto the new ontology.  The mapping then informs the migration of Keyword labeling of datasets between versions.
