\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

Versioning information is widespread across devices and software in the modern world.  From the numbering of the latest smart phone to the patchnumber of the newest release of MATLAB, scientists must deal with a range of labels and formats when performing their research.  Science data, likewise, also has a tendancy to change.  

Agencies and research groups have collected new data at an incredible rate.  The amount of data housed by NASA quadrupled from 2001 to 2004 \cite{barkstromLibrary} and high energy physics labs can generate on the order of 4000 new datasets every day \cite{ATLAS}.

Many different views of versioning has appeared in the literature.  When Barkstrom and various other experts refer to data versioning, they are actually referring to data provenance.
