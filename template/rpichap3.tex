\chapter{MODEL SPECIFICATION}\label{ch:model}

\section{Introduction}

A versioning data model needs to address a variety of needs not met by provenance models.
In PROV-O and PAV, the modeled entities are exclusively one-dimensional with each version leading sequentially to the next one.
The HCLS model, Figure \ref{HCLSModel}, and Barkstrom model, Figure \ref{hierarchy}, however, display a more complex two-dimensional hierarchy.
The tree models better capture the tiered granularity separating different versions which can result from a higher-tier macro change.
These models also tightly couple new objects with changes to their underlying attributes.
The tiered approach more clearly explains the scale on which two objects within the tree differ.

Provenance models provide concepts to sequentially order data objects but lack the ability to convey differences between farther spanning objects.
In Figure \ref{hierarchy}, the left-most leaf node and the right-most leaf node differ by three changes at the data product level.
A provenance model would need to rely on qualified properties to connect further annotations and describe the higher level changes.
Remember that a common function of versioning systems is to provide a method to determine the amount of change or difference between two objects of a work.
Much of the differences become lost when compressed into a single relation in a provenance graph.
Additional annotations are often in natural language and do not provide a regular attribute to quantify.

The provenance models, on the other hand, do a much better job in explicitly defining the connection between objects which the tree models rely on structure to imply.
The model must contain a mechanism to convey how changes to parts of an object contribute to that object's transition into a new version.
The fundamental operations---\textbf{add}, \textbf{invalidate}, and \textbf{modify}---are used by the model to capture change in a more detailed manner.
These details provide a mechanism to measure change between versions with better clarity than current methods.

\section{Model Objects}

The versioning model incorporates three kinds of objects: \textbf{versions}, \textbf{attributes}, and \textbf{changes}.
A \textbf{version} object represents the items being compared such as a book or spreadsheet.
In PROV, a \textbf{version} would likely correspond with the \textit{prov:Entity} involved in a \textit{prov:wasRevisionOf} property.
The \textbf{attribute} object refers to specific parts which make up a \textbf{version}.
\textbf{Attributes} could be lines in a book or columns in a spreadsheet.
Including \textbf{attributes} addresses the lack of detail involved in a \textit{prov:wasRevisionOf} or \textit{pav:previousVersion}.
The relationship between \textbf{versions} and \textbf{attributes} captures the influence that changes in the underlying part will have on the overarching \textbf{version}.
Because the model refers to specific parts of a \textbf{version}, the \textbf{version} concept corresponds most closely with a FRBR \textbf{manifestation} rather than an \textbf{expression}.
The presence or absence of an \textbf{attribute} is used to determine the kind of \textbf{change} which occurs to the \textbf{attribute} between \textbf{versions}.
\textbf{Changes} are used to link together \textbf{attributes} from different \textbf{versions}.
The \textbf{change} captures a difference between the old \textbf{version} state and the new \textbf{version} state.
While the \textbf{change} object greatly resembles a PROV qualified property, its form can change depending on the kind of \textbf{change}, like a \textit{schema:UpdateAction}.

\subsection{Left-hand Right-hand Convention}

In the following diagrams and figures, the original or base version and its attributes will be placed on the left-hand side and the new version will be placed on the right-hand side with its attributes.
References to the versions as previous and next are avoided since sequencing may not play a major role in distinguishing versions.
Scientific data in large repositories often track sequential releases of data, but a book may have different versions distinguished by printed language.
To recognize this distinction, objects will be referred to as the left-hand \textbf{version} or left-hand \textbf{attribute} when they are not sequentially or temporally related.

\section{Model Changes}

The model bases \textbf{changes} around the three core versioning operations because their commonality across systems provides a fundamental basis for comparisons.
\textbf{Additions} occur when an \textbf{attribute} appears only in the right-hand \textbf{version}.
When an \textbf{attribute} only shows up in the left-hand \textbf{version}, the model captures this as an \textbf{invalidation}.
Finally, a \textbf{modification} change has \textbf{attributes} in both the left and right-hand \textbf{versions}, but it only connects two \textbf{attributes} if their values are different.
These three combinations cover the possible situations within the model.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\vspace{0.0in} % normally the command here would be \includegraphics
	%	\includegraphics{figures/Addition.png}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw, rectangle}]
	\begin{scope}[node distance=20mm and 20mm]
	\node (c) [scale=1.25] at (1,0) {Change M};
	\node (1) [above left=of c, scale=1.25] {Version 1};
	\node (2) [above right=of c, scale=1.25] {Version 2};
	\node (a1) [below =of 1, scale=1.25] {Attribute 1};
	\node (a2) [below =of 2, scale=1.25] {Attribute 2};
	
	\draw [line width=2pt,->] (a1) -- (c);
	\draw [line width=2pt,->] (c) -- (a2);
	\draw [line width=2pt, ->] (1) -- (a1);
	\draw [line width=2pt, ->] (2) -- (a2);
	\end{scope}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Model of the relationships between Versions 1 and 2 when modifying Attribute 1 from Version 1 as a result of Change M, resulting in Attribute 2 from Version 2}
	\label{ModificationFig}  % the \label command comes AFTER the caption
\end{figure}

\subsection{Modification}

The \textbf{modification} relation occurs when an \textbf{attribute} appears in both \textbf{versions} and their values are different.
In Figure \ref{ModificationFig}, a \textbf{modification} is captured between two versions.
Each \textbf{version} has an \textbf{attribute}, Attribute 1 and Attribute 2, respectively.
Finally, a \textbf{change} object connects the two \textbf{attributes}, denoting that the values described by the attribute are different.

The specific values pertaining to Attribute 1 and Attribute 2 are not captured by the model because acknowledging that a difference exists is more important.
Extending the model to properly communicate the significance of a modification for a wide variety of domains would require sizable domain knowledge and would be outside the scope for this project.
In addition, the model would essentially begin storing a copy of the data set, leading to space and redundancy concerns.

\subsection{Addition}

In Figure \ref{AdditionFig}, the \textbf{addition} model differs from the \textbf{modification} construction by the absence of Attribute 1.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\vspace{0.0in} % normally the command here would be \includegraphics
	%	\includegraphics{figures/Addition.png}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw, rectangle}]
	\begin{scope}[node distance=20mm and 20mm]
	\node (c) [scale=1.25] at (1,0) {Change A};
	\node (1) [above left=of c, scale=1.25] {Version 1};
	\node (2) [above right=of c, scale=1.25] {Version 2};
	\node (a) [below =of 2, scale=1.25] {Attribute 2};
	
	\draw [line width=2pt,->] (1) -- (c);
	\draw [line width=2pt,->] (c) -- (a);
	\draw [line width=2pt, ->] (2) -- (a);
	\end{scope}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Model of the relationships between Versions 1 and 2 when adding an Attribute 2 to Version 2 as a result of Change A}
	\label{AdditionFig}  % the \label command comes AFTER the caption
\end{figure}
The absence creates a disconnect between ``Version 1" and ``Change A".
A property is used to create a path between the two \textbf{attributes} to indicate the contribution of  ``Version 1" to the change's lineage.
The path does not show that ``Version 1" informs or creates ``Attribute 2", while that may be true.
The construction was also chosen to create a symmetric orientation with the \textbf{invalidation} change.


\subsection{Invalidation}

The \textit{invalidation} model has a missing \textbf{attribute} on the right-hand side of the relation, contrary to the \textbf{addition} construction.
As a result of the invalidation, an attribute no longer exists in the right-hand \textbf{version}.
As seen in Figure \ref{InvalidationFig}, the invalidation change concept matches to the Version 2 object.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\vspace{0.0in} % normally the command here would be \includegraphics
	%	\includegraphics{figures/Addition.png}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw, rectangle}]
	\begin{scope}[node distance=15mm and 20mm]
	\node (c) [scale=1.25] at (1,0) {Change I};
	\node (1) [above left=of c, scale=1.25] {Version 1};
	\node (2) [above right=of c, scale=1.25] {Version 2};
	\node (a) [below =of 1, scale=1.25] {Attribute 1};
	
	\draw [line width=2pt,->] (a) -- (c);
	\draw [line width=2pt,->] (c) -- (2);
	\draw [line width=2pt, ->] (1) -- (a);
	\end{scope}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Model of the relationships between Versions 1 and 2 when invalidating Attribute 1 from Version 1 as a result of Change I}
	\label{InvalidationFig}  % the \label command comes AFTER the caption
\end{figure}
Just like in \textbf{addition} model, this construction maintains a link between the two \textbf{version} objects.
In this case, it makes more conceptual sense, however, because ``Version 2" invalidates ``Attribute 1" by omitting it.


\section{Summary}

The versioning model provides a method to capture change information in greater detail than current provenance models.
The inclusion of \textbf{versions} and \textbf{attributes} into the model connect changing items with the objects they influence.
The \textbf{changes} create a ladder-like structure to connect together \textbf{version} objects in greater detail.
Each rung of the ladder can not only be counted, but also grouped into types of change according to the respective operation.
The method of instantiating a versioning graph will be covered in Chapter \ref{ch:implement}.
